QCopterMain.ino To-Do List

This list contains important tasks that are required to complete the code.
Feel free to add/complete tasks, if I can give people permissions to edit these files I will.



To-Do:

1) Write code that integrates data to find current position, velocity, angle, rate of rotation

2)Pending actual construction, write code that converts knowledge of state into control sequences (!!HARD I THINK!!)
