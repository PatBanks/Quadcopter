Description
-----------

The code contained within this repository is intended to act as the complete control system for a X-configuration quadcopter with 9-axis sensor capability. Specifically, the code is written for compatability with the LSM303DLHC Accel+Compass and the Osepp MPU3000/MPU3050 gyro.
