Description
-----------

The code contained within this repository is intended to act as the complete control system for a X-configuration<br />
quadcopter with 6-axis sensor capability. Specifically, the code is written for compatability with the LSM303DLHC <br /> 
Accel+Compass and the Osepp MPU3000/MPU3050 gyro. <br />

Under development currently:

1) Sensor noise reduction

2) Smooth motor control
